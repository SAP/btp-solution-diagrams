#  BTP Solution Diagram draw.io libraries

How to get started with  [drawio](https://drawio.com/) is documented in the guideline which you can find in the [Getting started](https://sap.github.io/btp-solution-diagrams/docs/solution_diagr_intro/intro/) section.

To simplify the usage of the BTP Solution Diagrams, we provide a set of libraries which can be used in draw.io. The libraries are available in the [SAP BTP Solution Diagrams GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP/btp-solution-diagrams)

The custom libraies are avilble here as so called custom draw.io libraries. You can use them in draw.io by importing the libraries from the GitHub repository.
To jump start with the libraries, you can use the the xml files from here: [20-02-99-sap-btp-service-icons-all](../draw.io/20-02-99-sap-btp-service-icons-all/)

This contains all released BTP service icons:
